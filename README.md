🌍 AFIYAPAL  – Your AI-Powered Health Assistant for African Lives

✨ Inspiration

We created AFIYAPAL  to make healthcare more accessible, inclusive, and smarter using AI and low-tech communication solutions. By integrating tools like Gemini AI and we want to bridge the gap between healthcare providers and those who need them most  in their own language and via familiar channels.
